Title: Mass Spectrometry-Based Metabolomics Using Pure Ion Chromatograms
Version: 2.4.0
Author: Hongchao Ji
Maintainer: Hongchao Ji <ji.hongchao@foxmail.com>
Description: KPIC2 is an effective platform for LC-MS based metabolomics using pure ion chromatograms, which is developed for metabolomics studies. KPIC2 can detect pure ions accurately, align PICs across samples, group PICs to annotate isotope and adduct PICs, fill missing peaks and pattern recognition. High-resolution mass spectrometers like TOF and Orbitrap are more suitable.
